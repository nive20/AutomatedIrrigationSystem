## Short description

### What's the problem?

If our advancement towards technology is progress, then underutilizing the same in sectors like Irrigation is regress.Water overflow OR Water scarcity due to poor manageability of water supply 
Poor forecasting techniques of weather and soil dampness.Lack of water source capacity management  and automation.Less adaption of technology towards irrigation


### How can technology help?

We can leverage the Cloud and IoT concepts in building the mentioend solution

### The idea

Water resource management using IoT and Cloud infrastructure which can minimize the wastage and distribute effectively and efficiently using forecast and sensor technologies 
This solution caters to Public and Private Irrigation sectors.High availability and seamless integration with water resources.Alert and Notification system which helps in sustainable distribution & management
Disaster Management and Farm Friendly 

## Demo video

[![Watch the video](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Liquid-Prep/blob/master/images/readme/IBM-interview-video-image.png)](https://youtu.be/vOgCOoy_Bx0)

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Long description

[More detail is available here](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md)

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

Weather and Soil dampness calculations
Tap switching and channel identification

Future Roadmap

Capacity calculation in Units 
Reporting using AI / ML techniques
End user communication capability
Analytics at Control Center level
Automated outflow incase of water scarcity with proper channeling 


## Getting started
